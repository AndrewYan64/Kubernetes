# Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes and what does it have to do with holders? Where did this strange word come from? The settled upon birthplace is from the Greek, signifying "helmsman" or "cruising ace." 

Here's the manner by which Red Hat innovation evangelist Gordon Haff clarifies Kubernetes in his book, "From Pots and Vats to Programs and Apps," co-created with Red Hat Senior Distinguished Engineer William Henry: 

Kubernetes takes out large numbers of the manual cycles engaged with sending and scaling containerized applications. 

"Kubernetes, or k8s (k, 8 characters, sâ€¦ get it?), or 'kube' in case you're into quickness, is an open source stage that robotizes Linux compartment activities. It disposes of a large number of the manual cycles associated with conveying and scaling containerized applications," Haff and Henry compose. "All in all, you can bunch together gatherings of hosts running Linux compartments, and Kubernetes helps you effectively and proficiently deal with those groups." 

Here's the means by which Dan Kohn, leader head of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in a web recording with Gordon Haff, clarified it: "Containerization is this pattern that is assuming control over the world to permit individuals to run a wide range of various applications in a wide range of conditions. At the point when they do that, they need a coordination arrangement to monitor those compartments and timetable them and organize them. Kubernetes is an inexorably well known approach to do that." 

The latest variant of Kubernetes, 1.19, was delivered in August 2020. (This much of the time refreshed task has had discharges on about a quarterly premise as of late.)
